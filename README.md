# THE [initial] IDEA
TeamViewer as a Remote Interface, with a Sidebar for controlling all features like:
* A SmartPostBox (with OpenCV for identification, able to open up, with Notification)
* A Home/holiday home smart Interface (security system, watering, video surveillance (opencv zones))
* A Server Room surveillance (power consumption, video surveillance (opencv zones)), Hardware trigger






# FEATUTRES


# PARTS
* RPI 3b - Control of the complete postbox
* Arduino - Controls all actors/sensors through the RPI
* TeamViwer - System monitoring to the user
* Heroku - Hosting the backend and the user frontend
* DC Gear Motor with L295D H Bridge - open/close the front door

## SENSORS
* Loadcell - to weight the packages
* 2x lightgates - to monitor the gate state
* DHT22 - monitor temperature and humidity of the inside the postbox
* Barcode Scanner - to scan the packages to indentify them
